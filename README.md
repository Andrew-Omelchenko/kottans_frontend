## Task 1
- (Done) Finish the courses (1, 2 and 3) and put the screenshots of the finished lessons lists in the task_1 folder and the links in the README.md. Also read 4,5 articles.
- Good articles, request verbs were new to me, but URLs and status codes weren't.
- "...where there never were anywhere near enough addresses allocated for the number of users." (Citation from Lesson 5 of course "Networking for Web Developers").
